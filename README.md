This app is a simple Single Page Application (SPA) that can navigate between pages. When the user is logged in, his name is shown in the header of all pages (Login information is stored and received through localStorage).
And to navigate between pages, the Navigate and useNavigate components from react-router-dom were used. This app is implemented by HTML, CSS and React.js.
